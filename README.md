# match-three-puzzle-game
This is a match-three puzzle game in Unity, developed while following "Make a Match-Three Puzzle Game in Unity" course by Wilmer Lin on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/). 

There are 3 game modes: 

- with timer countdown;
- with moves countdown;
- with collection goals.

There are also some advanced game features like bombs and boosters. 

By developing the game and following the Udemy course, I developed my C# and Unity skills.
