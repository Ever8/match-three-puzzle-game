# match-three-puzzle-game

**1. Introduction** 

Here you can find my C# scripts for a match-three puzzle game in Unity, developed while following "Make a Match-Three Puzzle Game in Unity" course by Wilmer Lin on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/make-a-puzzle-match-game-in-unity/). 

There are 3 game modes: 

- with timer countdown;
- with moves countdown;
- with collection goals.

There are also some advanced game features like bombs and boosters. 

Technologies and concepts used are Unity, C#, Visual Studio, and Object Oriented Programming (OOP). 

I decided to use Unity instead of Unreal because in my opinion, Unity has better documentation and beginner tutorials than Unreal, so it was easier to learn how to use it than Unreal. At least it was back in November 2021, when I was deciding whether to use Unity or Unreal for my game development project.

**3. Features I hope to implemet in the future**

In the future I would like to reskin the game, and implement a new feature called "shuffle till you make it". The "shuffle till you make it" feature would allow players to reshuffle the board for a limited number of times, when eg. there are no obvious moves left, but players haven't reached the level goal yet.
